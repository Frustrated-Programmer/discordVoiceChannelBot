# Discord Voice Channel Bot
This bot was made for @Shadowâ„¢#8337 from [Discord](https://discordapp.com)<br>
He requested for a bot that would play YouTube Live Streams.<br>
This Bot is fully capable of doing so!

As I would love making more features for this bot, Don't hesitate to use the `-suggest` command!
